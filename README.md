# HotelManagementApp

In this Project we created a C# complete application of Hotel Reservation. The Application starts with a nice looking splash form which leads to a login form. The login form will be connected to a database, if the user id and password match the database entries, the user will login to the main form.
From the main form, the user can go to the Staff form. He can add, edit, delete and view Staff.
The User can manage the different Rooms, he can add, edit or update the Rooms.
The User can manage the different Clients which can be allocated for reservation,by adding, editing and deleting them.
Finally, the user can filter the room by room number and filter only free or busy rooms. Once a room is reserved, it's state is updated from free to busy.
Once a Room is reserved, it can not be allocated for another reservation.
